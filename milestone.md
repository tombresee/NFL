### Some resources that should help you in this process:
 - We have put together a [sample CodaLab competition](https://github.com/bethard/semeval-codalab) that you can use as a starting point for your taskâ€™s competition: 
 - Example Competition on CodaLab for Emotion Intensity: [CodaLab site](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/16380), [Code](https://github.com/felipebravom/EmoInt/tree/master/codalab)
 - Example Competition on CodaLab for Clinical TempEval: [CodaLab site](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/15621), [Code](https://github.com/bethard/clinical-tempeval)
 - Post your questions and issues on CodaLab [here](https://github.com/codalab/codalab-competitions/issues)
   - Search first to see if a similar question has already been asked and answered.
   - You can also post your questions to the semeval-task-organizers@googlegroups.com mailing group where other task organizers and semeval organizers might be of help.
